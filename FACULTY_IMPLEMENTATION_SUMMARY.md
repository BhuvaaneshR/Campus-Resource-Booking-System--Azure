- Protected routes with authentication middleware

#### Route Structure:
- `/faculty/dashboard` - Main faculty landing page
- `/faculty/booking-request` - New booking request form
- `/faculty/my-bookings` - Personal bookings management

## ðŸ”’ Security & Access Control

### Authentication
- JWT token validation for all API endpoints
- User context injection for secure data access
- Role-based route protection

### Authorization
- **Faculty**: Can view calendar, submit requests, manage own bookings
- **Placement Executive**: All faculty permissions + urgent booking override
- **Portal Admin**: Full system access (existing functionality)

### Data Protection
- Users can only view/modify their own booking requests
- Role verification before priority booking actions
- Secure database queries with parameterization

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- **Material-UI components** for consistency
- **Role-specific color themes** (Placement Executives get secondary color)
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
- **Loading states** and **error handling**

### User Workflow
1. **Login** â†’ Role detection â†’ Dashboard redirect
2. **Browse calendar** â†’ Identify available time slots
3. **Submit request** â†’ Form validation â†’ Confirmation
4. **Track status** â†’ View in My Bookings â†’ Receive updates

### Accessibility
- **Clear navigation** with role indicators
- **Status chips** with color coding
- **Descriptive error messages**
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions

## ðŸ“Š Key Business Logic

### Booking Approval Workflow
1. Faculty submits request â†’ "Pending Approval"
2. Admin reviews â†’ Approve/Reject
3. Approved â†’ "Confirmed" â†’ Appears on calendar
4. Rejected â†’ "Rejected" with reason

### Priority Booking Logic
1. Placement Executive selects urgent booking
2. System checks for conflicts
3. Conflicting bookings â†’ "Cancelled - Overridden"  
4. New booking â†’ Immediately "Confirmed"
5. Affected users notified (future: Logic Apps)

### Conflict Resolution
- **Standard requests**: Blocked if resource unavailable
- **Priority requests**: Override existing bookings
- **Real-time validation** during form submission

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

- Mock data for different scenarios
- Expected behaviors and success criteria
- Database setup instructions
